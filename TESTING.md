# PluginGeek Testing Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines the regression testing strategy for the PluginGeek intelligent intent recognition and tool execution system.

## Core Testing Philosophy
Test from simple to complex, ensuring each layer of functionality works before moving to the next. Each test builds upon the previous one to validate system reliability.

## Regression Testing Suite

### 1. Basic File Operations
**Purpose**: Validate fundamental tool generation and execution
- **Test**: `"create a test.txt file"`
- **Success Criteria**:
  - Single file created in current directory
  - No unnecessary directory creation
  - Tool validation passes
  - File content is appropriate

### 2. Path Handling
**Purpose**: Validate directory creation and file placement logic
- **Test**: `"create a hello.txt file inside a World directory"`
- **Success Criteria**:
  - Directory created first
  - File created inside directory
  - Path relationships maintained
  - No path manipulation bugs

### 3. Simple App Creation
**Purpose**: Validate complete app generation workflow
- **Test**: `"create a basic node/express HelloWorld app in the helloGeek directory"`
- **Success Criteria**:
  - Project directory created correctly
  - package.json with proper dependencies
  - server.js with working code
  - Basic HTML/CSS files
  - npm install and start commands
  - App runs successfully

### 4. App Modification
**Purpose**: Validate incremental change capabilities
- **Test**: `"add a new route /about to the helloGeek app"`
- **Success Criteria**:
  - Existing app detected
  - New route added to server.js
  - No duplicate file creation
  - App still runs after modification

### 5. Complex App Creation
**Purpose**: Validate multi-component system generation
- **Test**: `"create a todo app with create, read, update, delete operations"`
- **Success Criteria**:
  - Full CRUD functionality
  - Multiple interconnected files
  - Proper error handling
  - User interface components

### 6. Complex App Modification
**Purpose**: Validate advanced enhancement capabilities
- **Test**: `"add user authentication to the todo app"`
- **Success Criteria**:
  - Existing functionality preserved
  - New security features added
  - Dependencies updated appropriately
  - Complex logic integration

## Edge Case Testing

### Path Resolution Variations
- `"create a file at the root"` → should create in `/Users/ccrocker/projects/`
- `"create a file in the root directory"` → should create in `/Users/ccrocker/projects/`
- `"create a file in the app folder"` → should create in `/Users/ccrocker/projects/app/`

### UI/UX Requirements
- `"give it a fancy blue UI"` → should generate CSS with blue styling
- `"make it look modern"` → should generate modern CSS framework
- `"add responsive design"` → should include mobile-friendly CSS

### Technology Stack Detection
- `"create a React app"` → should generate React-specific files
- `"create a Python Flask app"` → should generate Python/Flask structure
- `"create a full-stack app"` → should generate frontend + backend structure

## Test Execution Guidelines

### Before Each Test
1. Ensure server is running with latest code
2. Clear any existing test directories
3. Check server logs for errors

### During Test Execution
1. Monitor server logs for tool generation
2. Verify file creation in correct locations
3. Check tool validation results
4. Confirm execution success/failure

### After Each Test
1. Verify expected files exist
2. Test app functionality if applicable
3. Document any failures or unexpected behavior
4. Clean up test artifacts

## Common Failure Points

### Tool Generation Issues
- AI not following prompts correctly
- Invalid tool names generated
- Missing required parameters
- Incorrect target directories

### Execution Issues
- File naming problems (unknown.txt)
- Path manipulation bugs
- Tool validation failures
- Terminal command execution errors

### App Structure Issues
- Missing essential files
- Incorrect dependencies
- Broken file relationships
- Non-functional generated code

## Success Metrics

### Reliability
- 100% success rate on basic file operations
- 95%+ success rate on simple app creation
- 90%+ success rate on complex app creation

### Performance
- Basic operations: <5 seconds
- Simple app creation: <30 seconds
- Complex app creation: <2 minutes

### Quality
- Generated apps run without errors
- Files have appropriate content
- Dependencies are correctly specified
- Paths are consistent and logical

## Continuous Improvement

### After Each Test Run
1. Identify failure patterns
2. Update AI prompts if needed
3. Fix tool validation logic
4. Improve error handling
5. Document new edge cases

### Weekly Review
1. Analyze success rates
2. Identify common failure modes
3. Update testing strategy
4. Add new test cases
5. Optimize performance
